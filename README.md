# DAAP-GUI
User friendly DAAP designed to work on Windows, OSX and Linux Platforms
The current version is DAAP-v1.12.

Please read the file: v1.12OperatingInstructions.rtf for instructions on text preparation, dictionaries and DAAP operation.

Please refer questions and problems to DAAP@thereferentialprocess.org

There are several known difficulties that we expect to fix in future versions. These include:
A. If DAAP is opened in IDLE, some windows are left open after DAAP finishes.
B. The error correcting procedure could be easier; in particular, it would be better if one could correct the transcription errors directly in the EC file.
C. The windows procedures are somewhat cumbersome; it seems that one needs to push too many buttons on the Dictionaries page.
